CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSDL2_image.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "SDL2_image", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_image" with
  any of the following names:

    SDL2_imageConfig.cmake
    sdl2_image-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2_image" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_image_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SDL2_image" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
